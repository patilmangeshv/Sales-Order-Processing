4. Handling hardware back button on mobile for modal forms.
    Issue: When back button is used on modal form it don't close the modal form
            but it navigates back to the previous page in the URL. If the URL is
            the home page then it closes the app.
    Solution: 1. Capture the back button event on the modal form and dismiss the modal.
              2. Don't go back to the previous page after dismissing the modal
              3. Remove any phantom history when the modal is dismissed
